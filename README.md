# 👋 Hi, I'm Tina

🎯 A Technical Program Manager (TPM) with a NB system development background, currently transitioning into AI infrastructure and inference workflows.

I document and share technical learnings in a bilingual format (English/中文), with a focus on:

- 🔍 **AI Inference**: Triton Server, ONNX Runtime, Transformer-based models  
- 🛠 **TPM Skills**: Cross-functional collaboration, deployment flowcharts, debugging cases  
- 🧠 **Technical Learning**: Git, Linux, IT Support, MLOps, and Generative AI
