## Overview

This repository documents real-world TPM knowledge and lessons learned from building AI Server Systems.  
It combines theoretical concepts with practical resolution strategies.

---

## TPM Role in AI Infrastructure

- Align HW/FW/SW milestones in ML deployments
- Coordinate between ML engineers and infra engineers
- Manage ECO, build risks, and resource planning
- Oversee integration testing and validation sync points

---

## Technical Notes

- [`Triton Inference Architecture`](notes/triton-architecture-tpm.md)  
  Multi-framework AI model serving, batching strategies, resource optimization, and TPM touchpoints

- [`TPM Knowledge Map`](notes/tbd.md)  
  (Planned) TPM skills matrix, coordination model, and lifecycle checkpoints

---

## Case Studies

- [`HW-SW Integration Conflict Resolution`](notes/tpm-case-hw-sw-conflict.md)  
  How a TPM enabled an on-time EVT build by mitigating firmware gaps with fallback planning

---

## Visual Aids

> *(To be added)*  
> - AI Inference Stack Diagram  
> - ECO Timeline Overlay  
> - TPM Risk Resolution Matrix
